The revival of the objectively best Twitter video downloader bot ever known =^)

Before Starting:
You have to use bash (or terminal) in something like Ubuntu or something nerdy like that.
What you will need first is npm. So go and enter

```shell
sudo apt install npm
```

Now you want pm2 because this is going to crash time to time without any warning.
You also have more info on the process with this is you're into that.

```shell
npm install pm2 -g
```
Now that that's done, you should get to know about pm2 when handling the bot when you're finished with this guid of sorts here!
https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2

## How to get Started!
This bad boy requires Node.js, FFmpeg, and frei0r-plugins:

```shell
sudo apt install nodejs ffmpeg frei0r-plugins
```
Next you gotta make sure everything is extracted neatly in a folder, yeah?
And then you make sure that the terminal is in the folder you extraced everything
into with cd then the directory...
```shell
cd /Downloaded/using/this__vid3/
```
Just replace the /Downloaded/using/this__vid3/ with the actual directory though.

Finally, put your consumer key/secret and access token/secret obtained from the [Twitter apps page](https://developer.twitter.com/apps) inside `config.json` and run `pm2 start app.js` or without pm2, `node app.js`.

## Disclaimer
This is a parody of video downloader bots and does not actually send users download links. If you need an actual Twitter video downloader, I highly recommend [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/).
